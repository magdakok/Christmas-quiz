# CHRISTMAS QUIZ
It's my very first project after completing advanced CSS Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. The Quiz consists of 10 Christmas-related questions, each of which has four answers, and only one is correct. As a user clicks on an answer, there's a popup text informing whether is it right or not. After that previous question with the selected and correct answer is displayed in the sidebar. There's a correct and wrong answer's counter. 

My main goal was to practise the usage of grid and flexbox as well as having fun with some CSS properties and pseudoclasses. The website is supposed to be fully responsive.

I've just started a JavaScript course hence I'm convinced there's plenty of mistakes. I'll be gradually rebuilding the whole JavaScript code as I learn new features.
