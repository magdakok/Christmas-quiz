# CHRISTMAS QUIZ

## :movie_camera: https://magdakok.github.io/christmas-quiz/

It's my very first project after completing advanced CSS Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. The Quiz consists of 10 Christmas-related questions, each of which has four answers, and only one is correct. As a user clicks on an answer, there's a popup text informing whether is it right or not. After that previous question with the selected and correct answer is displayed in the sidebar. There's a correct and wrong answer's counter. 

### My goals:
* practise using grid and flexbox layout
* practise using pseudoclasses
* make fully responsive design
* make first step with JavaScript

### Still to improve:
I've just started a JavaScript course hence I'm convinced there's plenty of mistakes. I'll be gradually rebuilding the whole JavaScript code as I learn new features.
